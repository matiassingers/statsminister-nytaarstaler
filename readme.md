# Statsministerens nytårstaler
> collection of the Danish Prime Minister New Years addresses since 1998

I built a quick and dirty scraper with a Shell script for scraping and formatting all the speeches correctly.

## Data sources
See the `data.json` for each year, or check [`sources.md`](sources.md).

## Missing years
I was only able to find a text version of the New Years addresses from Statsministeriet since 1998, as according to [this page](http://www.stm.dk/_a_1612.html).

## Contributing
If you are able to find any New Years addresses that is currently missing the repo, please do contribute.

Also if you want to add additional information to the `data.json` file for each year - please go ahead and just file a PR for it.
