# Statsministerens nytårstaler
> collection of the Danish Prime Minister New Years addresses since 1995

I built a quick and dirty scraper with a Shell script for scraping and formatting the speeches from Statsministeriet correctly.

## Data sources
See the `data.json` for each year, or check [`sources.md`](sources.md).

## Missing years
Statsministeriet only have a text version of the New Years addresses since 1998, as according to [this page](http://www.stm.dk/_a_1612.html).

Berlingske Tidende had the speeches from [1995](http://www.b.dk/danmark/statsministerens-nytaarstale-1995), [1996](http://www.b.dk/danmark/statsministerens-nytaarstale-1996) and [1997](http://www.b.dk/danmark/statsministerens-nytaarstale-1997).

There were no New Years addresses the following years, according to the book ["Nu Gælder Det Danmark"](http://www.nytaarstale.dk/Ar_Uden_Tale/ar_uden_tale.html): 1947, 1960, 1972, 1968, 1975 and 1984.

I haven't been able to find a text version of any of the remaining years, and I might have to get it from an [epub version](https://itunes.apple.com/dk/book/nu-g-lder-det-danmark!-statsministrenes/id482910111) of the book ["Nu Gælder Det Danmark"](http://www.nytaarstale.dk/).
